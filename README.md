## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to get SmartRead up and running on your local machine.

### **Step 1: Get Your Gemini API Key**

This extension requires a Google Gemini API key to function.

1.  Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) to create your API key.
2.  Ensure that you have **enabled the "Gemini API"** and have **linked a billing account** in your Google Cloud project. The API has a generous free tier but requires a billing account for activation.

### **Step 2: Clone the Repository**

Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the project:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Indalu616/smart-read-extension.git](https://github.com/Indalu616/smart-read-extension.git)
Step 3: Install Dependencies
Navigate into the newly created project directory and install the necessary packages.

Bash

cd smart-read-extension
npm install
Step 4: Set Up Your API Key
In the root of the project, create a new file named .env.local.

Open the file and add your Gemini API key in the following format:

VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
Note: Replace "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" with the actual key you obtained from Google AI Studio.

Step 5: Build the Extension
Run the build command to create the production-ready extension files. This will generate a dist folder.

Bash

npm run build
Step 6: Load the Extension in Chrome
Open Google Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions.

Enable "Developer mode" using the toggle in the top-right corner.

Click the "Load unpacked" button.

In the file selection dialog, choose the dist folder that was created in your project directory.

The SmartRead AI extension icon should now appear in your Chrome toolbar!
